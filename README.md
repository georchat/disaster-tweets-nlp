# IBM Coursera Advanced Data Science Capstone

This repository demonstrates the results from the course Advanced Data Science Capstone offered by IBM on coursera. The case study is to predict whether a given tweet is about a real disaster or not, which is a challenge for natural language processing on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/overview).
